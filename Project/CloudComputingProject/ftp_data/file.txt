The quick brown fox jumps over REPLACE lazy dog journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step 
to err is human,to forgive divine 
better late the never,but never late is better
success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it 
The early bird catches REPLACE worm,but the secound mouse gets the cheese
